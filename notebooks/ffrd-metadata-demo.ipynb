    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "### Knowledge Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A knowledge graph is a type of knowledge representation that captures information as entities and their relationships to each other. It is a structured data model that is used to represent knowledge in a way that can be easily understood by both humans and machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a knowledge graph, information is represented as nodes, which are entities, and edges, which are the relationships between entities. These entities and relationships can be organized into a graph structure, which allows for efficient navigation and querying of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowledge graphs are commonly used to represent information in a variety of domains, including but not limited to, scientific research, healthcare, business, and social media. They are often used to support intelligent applications, such as question-answering systems, recommendation engines, and chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of knowledge graphs include Google's Knowledge Graph, which powers many of Google's search results, and the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry, which represents knowledge in the biological and biomedical domains.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ontologies / Controlled Vocabularies\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlled vocabularies in knowledge graphs are sets of standardized terms, concepts, or categories used to describe the entities and relationships within the graph. These vocabularies serve as a common language for data integration, retrieval, and analysis across different domains, applications, and communities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Controlled vocabularies are typically created and managed by subject matter experts, organizations, or standardization bodies to ensure consistency, accuracy, and interoperability of the data. They may include taxonomies, thesauri, ontologies, or other types of classification schemes that provide explicit definitions, relations, and constraints on the terms and their usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "In knowledge graphs, controlled vocabularies can be used to model and represent various types of knowledge, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Domain-specific concepts and properties (e.g., medical terms, chemical compounds, financial indicators)\n",
    "Relationships and dependencies among entities (e.g., part-of, located-in, influenced-by)\n",
    "Metadata and annotations (e.g., source, author, date, license)\n",
    "By using controlled vocabularies, knowledge graphs can improve the quality, consistency, and usability of the data, as well as enable more powerful querying, inference, and visualization capabilities. They also facilitate data sharing and integration across different systems and domains, which is particularly important in the context of the Semantic Web and linked data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vocabularies and Namespaces\n",
    "\n",
    "A namespace is a way of organizing identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names) in a program or system to avoid naming conflicts. It provides a unique identifier for each entity to ensure that there are no naming clashes. In other words, a namespace is a container for a set of identifiers that are used to uniquely identify a specific resource or object. In this case, namespaces are customized to specify locations (i.e. in the cloud, on a server) where project/model specific data is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an ontology is a formal specification of a shared conceptualization that represents a set of concepts and categories in a particular domain. It defines the relationships among the concepts and categories in a domain, along with their properties and attributes. An ontology provides a common vocabulary and a shared understanding of a domain, enabling systems to communicate with each other and reason about the domain.\n",
